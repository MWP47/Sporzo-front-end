# Edit Turf Update - Time-Based Pricing Support

## âœ… **Updated Edit Turf Functionality**

The edit turf feature has been enhanced to fully support the new time-based pricing system while maintaining backward compatibility with existing turfs.

### **ðŸ”§ Key Updates Made:**

#### **1. Enhanced Data Loading (TurfManagement.jsx)**
- **Smart Migration**: Automatically converts old pricing structure to new format
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handles turfs created before time-based pricing
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures all field configurations have proper pricing structure

#### **2. Improved TurfDetails Integration**
- **Owner Turf Support**: Loads owner-created turfs from localStorage
- **Dynamic Fallback**: Falls back to generated data for demo turfs
- **Pricing Structure**: Ensures all turfs have proper time-based pricing

#### **3. Seamless Migration Process**

**For Existing Turfs Without Field Configurations:**
```javascript
// Automatically creates default configuration
fieldConfigurations: [{
  id: 1,
  type: "11v11",
  name: "Full Field (11v11)",
  pricing: {
    dayPrice: "400",    // Uses existing price
    nightPrice: "",     // Empty, can be filled
    peakPrice: ""       // Empty, can be filled
  }
}]
```

**For Existing Turfs With Old Field Configurations:**
```javascript
// Adds pricing structure to existing configs
fieldConfigurations.map(config => ({
  ...config,
  pricing: config.pricing || {
    dayPrice: config.price || "",
    nightPrice: "",
    peakPrice: ""
  }
}))
```
